## Projects

### 1. [Game of Life](./Game-Of-Life)

A Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life with interactive animation using Matplotlib.  
Features:

- Random or predefined life forms.
- Start/Stop animation button.
- Configurable grid size.

---

### 2. [Photo Lab](./PhotoLab)

An image editing application built with PyQt5 and OpenCV.  
Features:

- Palette conversion: grayscale, sepia (with intensity), negative.
- Load, drag-and-drop, and save images.
- GUI with side panels for tool options.
- Planned: morphology filters and histogram equalization.

---

### 3. [Terrain Generation](./Terrain-Generation)

Procedural terrain generator using the Diamond-Square algorithm.  
Features:

- Generates 2D heightmaps.
- Adjustable grid size (must be 2^n + 1).
- Optional seed for reproducible terrains.
- Visualizes the terrain using Matplotlib.
- Smooth or rough terrains depending on randomization.

### 4. [Mandelbrot Fractal Generator](./Mandelbrot-Fractal)

Generates Mandelbrot-type fractals for a fixed complex parameter.  
Features:

- Adjustable grid resolution and max iterations.
- Choose the complex constant `c`.
- Displays iteration counts as a heatmap.
- Planned: performance improvements and vectorized computation.
